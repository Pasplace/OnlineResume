<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tabletop Role-playing Games</strong></li>
<p>In my final semester of university, my friend, Robert Sturgeon, and I started a club in which we played tabletop role-playing games with a group of french university students.
We started this club in an effort to practice the French language outside of a scholarly context, and above all, to have fun! This experience lead to us being featured on the french television
network known as Radio-Canada, as well as being featured on their live radio show to talk about our club and hobby. Finally, Robert and I went on to write a research paper investigating the
pedagogical applications French role-playing games could have in the classroom.</p>
<li><strong>Physical Activity</strong></li>
<p>I believe that in order to reach peak performance in one's life, it is necessary to maintain positive physical activity habits. This is a passion that I hope to pass
on to students, as under 10% of Canadian children are meeting physical activity requirements currently.</p>
<li><strong>Coding</strong></li>
<p>During my Fall 2019 internship, I was able to learn how to use several elementary coding tools that I then was able to teach to students. Since then, I have unearthed an interest in
Computer technologies. This very website that you are browsing is a product of that interest, as I have built it personally through taking online coding courses.</p>
<li><strong>History</strong></li>
<p>Anything history related is right up my alley. I love reading historical books and novels to learn more about specific time periods and key events in human history. Some of my favorite history books that I have read recently are:<br>
-Comme si j'Ã©tais seul; <em>Marco Magini</em><br>
-The 100-Year-Old Man That Climbed Out Of A Window And Disappeared; <em>Jonas Jonasson</em><br>
-Ordinary Men; <em>Christopher Browning</em><br>
-Cold Fire: Kennedy's Northern Front; <em>John Boyko</em></p><br>
<li><strong>Language Learning</strong></li>
<p>Having been a French Immersion student almost all of my life, I have understandably taken a liking to language learning and the benefits that lie therein. Through this field of study,
I have ammassed proficiencies in the English, French and Spanish languages. I hope to learn more languages and live more cultural experiences over the next few years.</p>
<li><strong>Jiu-Jitsu</strong></li>
<p>In my final semester of university, I decided to join the University of Regina's Jiu-Jitsu club. I enjoyed learning this martial art
and got to meet new people through this experience.</p>
